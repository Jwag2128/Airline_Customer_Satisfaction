# Airline_Customer_Satisfaction

## What factors lead to the happiest passengers?
## This project will explore over 25,000 passenger surveys from a real airline.  The data was cleaned using Python and loaded into a SQL database.  Multiple tables were created to focus on the different stages of airline travel satisfaction and reflect the customer's journey from booking to post flight baggage handling.
